Similar job application process to site such as Indeed or LinkedIn. Constructed using swing and awt.

## What is Picker/Brain?

If you read the source code of this project you will notice that the name and object type picker and brain appear repeatedly. This is because the two job types that are "allowed" are artists and scientists.
Obviously, this could be expanded but for simplicity sake I decided to do so regardless. Moreover, if the application were developed further, it would be useful to crete new objects for different jobs.

## Why did you choose to use Java for this project?

I chose Java because, in all honesty, I have very little experience in proper graphic design but wanted to build software regardless. As a result, I used vanilla java libraries to construct the afromentioned
project. 

## What is the match ages/pay aspect functions of the code?

Using hashmaps and arraylist, the original application had another page dedicated to matching/pairing artists with scientists. The project was originally designed to match a singular artist with a singular
scientist, under the guise of colloborating for some undefined project. However, as my aspirations for the project changed, so did the UI and I ultimately scrapped the page from the src files entirely.
However, I decided to leave in the algorithm that I created for matching them in anyways because a) it took me a while to code and b) there is still some utility for these functions even if the original
vision of the project has changed.
